    <p>
        I am a Computer Science Engineering student with strong interest in <strong>frontend development</strong>. I enjoy building clean and user-friendly web interfaces. My journey in computer science began with a curiosity about how websites are built, and I've since developed skills in <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. I'm passionate about creating responsive and accessible web applications that provide a great user experience. In addition to web development, I have a solid foundation in <strong>Object-Oriented Programming using C++</strong> and <strong>DBMS with PostgreSQL</strong>. I am eager to apply my skills in real-world projects and continue learning in this ever-evolving field.
